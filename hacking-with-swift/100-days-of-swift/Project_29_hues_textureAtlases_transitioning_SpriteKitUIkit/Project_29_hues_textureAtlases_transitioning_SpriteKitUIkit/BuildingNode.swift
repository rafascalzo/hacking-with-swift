 setup() will do the basic work required to make this thing a building: setting its name, texture, and physics.
 configurePhysics() will set up per-pixel physics for the sprite's current texture.
 drawBuilding() will do the Core Graphics rendering of a building, and return it as a UIImage.

     Create a new Core Graphics context the size of our building.
     Fill it with a rectangle that's one of three colors.
     Draw windows all over the building in one of two colors: there's either a light on (yellow) or not (gray).
     Pull out the result as a UIImage and return it for use elsewhere.
     
     We will use HSB color to control saturation and brightness (to achieve pastel-colors)
     We will use stride(), which lets you loop from one number to another with a specific interval
     
     We're going to use this to count from the left edge of the building to the right edge in intervals of 40, to position our windows. We'll also do this vertically, to position the windows across the whole height of the building. To make it a little more attractive, we'll actually indent the left and right edges by 10 points.
     That means "count from 10 up to the height of the building minus 10, in intervals of 40." So, it will go 10, 50, 90, 130, and so on. Note that stride() has two variants: stride(from:to:by:) and stride(from:through:by). The first counts up to but excluding the to parameter, whereas the second counts up to and including the through parameter. We'll be using stride(from:to:by:) below.
