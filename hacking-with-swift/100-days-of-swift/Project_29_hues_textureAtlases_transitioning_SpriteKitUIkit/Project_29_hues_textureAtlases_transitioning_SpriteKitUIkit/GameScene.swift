SpriteKit uses a number of optimizations to help its physics simulation work at high speed. These optimizations don't work well with small, fast-moving objects, and our banana is just such a thing. To be sure everything works as intended, we're going to enable the usesPreciseCollisionDetection property for the banana's physics body. This works slower, but it's fine for occasional use.
 
 I said we needed to make the banana move in "the correct direction" without really explaining how we get to that. This isn't a trigonometry book, so here's the answer as briefly as possible: if we calculate the cosine of our angle in radians it will tell us how much horizontal momentum to apply, and if we calculate the sine of our angle in radians it will tell us how much vertical momentum to apply.
 
 Once that momentum is calculated, we multiply it by the velocity we calculated (or negative velocity in the case of being player 2, because we want to throw to the left), and turn it into a CGVector. Remember, a vector is like an arrow where its base is at 0,0 (our current position) and tip at the point we specify, so this effectively points an arrow in the direction the banana should move.

 To make the banana actually move, we use the applyImpulse() method of its physics body, which accepts a CGVector as its only parameter and gives it a physical push in that direction.
 
 To transition from one scene to another, you first create the scene, then create a transition using the list available from SKTransition, then finally use the presentScene() method of our scene's view, passing in the new scene and the transition you created. For example, this will cross-fade in a new scene over 2 seconds:

 let newGame = GameScene(size: self.size)
 let transition = SKTransition.crossFade(withDuration: 2)
 self.view?.presentScene(newGame, transition: transition)
