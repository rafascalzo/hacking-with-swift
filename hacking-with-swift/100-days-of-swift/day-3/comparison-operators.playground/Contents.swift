//Swift has several operators that perform comparison, and these work more or less like you would expect in mathematics.
//
//Let’s start with a couple of example variables so we have something to work with:

let firstScore = 6
let secondScore = 4
//There are two operators that check for equality: == checks two values are the same, and != (pronounced “not equals”) checks two values are not the same:

firstScore == secondScore
firstScore != secondScore
//There are four operators for comparing whether one value is greater than, less than, or equal to another. These are just like in mathematics:

firstScore < secondScore
firstScore >= secondScore
//Each of these also work with strings, because strings have a natural alphabetical order:

"Taylor" <= "Swift"
